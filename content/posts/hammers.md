# Hammers

> I suppose it is tempting, if the only tool you have is a hammer, to treat everything as if it were a nail.  
> ~ Abraham Maslow

1. If the only thing you have is a hammer, then everything looks like a nail. I do job of cooking and need to chop vegetables with a knife... O people of hammer world, do not hate me for this!  
2. There are communities built around hammer. Hammer is what they live on and thrived for ages. That doesn't mean drilling machines have no use.  
3. People use hammer to help or hurt people. Hammer in itself is neither good or evil. It is not about the hammer. It is about people. Hammer was, is and will always be a medium of expression.  
  
**PS(intended): Replace the hammer with an ideology.**

This is an experimentation with the idea of [Maslow's hammer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_the_instrument).
